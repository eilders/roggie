                <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

                <h4>How does the <i>Safe &#038; Pure</i> Conditioner work?</h4>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        When installed in a water supply line, it controls the formation of scale and corrosion deposits without the use of chemicals. Water passing through the alternating magnetic fields causes most minerals (iron excepted) to stay suspended in the water so they cannot form a hard, brittle scale. The entire process bonds calcium ions to each other rather than to your plumbing and plumbing fixtures. Water passes, under pressure, and with minimal turbulence, through alternating magnetic lines of force perpendicular to the water&#8217;s flow direction. This causes a polarizing effect upon non-polar constituents in the water, and provides the energy of activation level necessary to cause the dissolved Calcium Carbonate (Calcite) CaCO3 within the water to recombine and form &#8220;aragonite&#8221; (an amorphous powdery form) when the solubility limit is reached.  Aragonite can easily remain suspended in the water stream rather than attaching to system walls as &#8220;scale&#8221;. The presence of aragonite in the water provides an additional benefit in terms of corrosion protection. A thin film of the soft aragonite, which normally forms as a result of long term magnetic treatment, actually prevents free oxygen within the water from attacking the metallic components through which the water travels, thus preventing corrosion. The magnetic technology is used by the US Department of Energy for de-scaling.

                <h4>How is your product different from traditional water softeners?</h4>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        Most water hardness treatment systems use ion exchange with salt as a regenerate which can have adverse effects on our health and the environment. While ion exchange systems substitute salt (sodium) for calcium, the  <i>Safe &#038; Pure</i> System transforms dissolved calcium to crystallized calcium. Calcium in its crystallized state is rendered harmless and free from its hard properties and scaling effects.
                    </p>
                </blockquote>

                <h4>What is your product used for?</h4>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        The <i>Safe &#038; Pure</i> System has several uses. It is primarily used for residential applications where superior water is desired for both taste and functional use. It is also used for commercial applications where scale prevention is required, such as; water heater pretreatment, reverse osmosis pretreatment, etc.
                    </p>
                </blockquote>

                <h4>What is special about the Safe &#038; Pure System?</h4>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        Electro-magnetic water treatment is the most widely used, recognized and reliable maintenance-free system available today. In addition, recent local bans on soft water equipment or waste water discharge permits are not applicable to this system.
                    </p>
                </blockquote>

                <h4>What is so important about not using chemicals or sodium in treating the water?</h4>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        1. You are not spending money on them.<br />
                        2. You are not ingesting them in part or in whole.<br />
                        3. You are not adding to the pollution of the water supplies.
                    </p>
                </blockquote>

                <h4>If the <i>Safe &#038; Pure</i> System does not use chemicals or sodium, what does it use?</h4>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        The <i>Safe &#038; Pure</i> System alters the state of the water through a multi-stage magnetic process. It does not add anything to it. The filter system is Bacteriostatic to inhibit bacteria growth as well as removing harmful chemicals, taste and odor. Improving the quality of the water from all faucets in your home. 
                    </p>
                </blockquote>

                <h4>How much water does it use or backwash?</h4>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        None. It does not backwash so it uses no electricity and has no water waste.
                    </p>
                </blockquote>

                <h4>Will the water test soft after the system is installed?</h4>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        NO. Remember that the calcium is still present in the water but in an altered state. A test for hardness in reality is a test for the presence of minerals Calcium and Magnesium which have naturally hard properties. Our system renders these harmless.
                    </p>
                </blockquote>

                <h4>Won&#8217;t the calcium crystals revert back to their dissolved state in my water heater?</h4>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        As part of the <i>Safe &#038; Pure</i> System we install an additional electro-magnetic unit at the hot water tank to insure that when the water does sit, for example if you are away on vacation, as soon as water is drawn through the unit the water is conditioned and any water that has been converted back to hard will quickly wash through. This prevents any scale from building up over time.
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
